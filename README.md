# CISC499
Independent research project on the content of a dark web cyber blackhat forum. 
Utilized BERTopic neural network to parse and analyze conversations, resulting in a deeper understanding of the topics discussed by participants. 
Further work will be done to isolate specific conversations for further analysis to aid in protecting against cyber attacks.

Contents:
- csv_parse.ipynb - Processing raw data into the proper input for BERTopic. Applying reduction techniques to further reduce the complexity of the data
- simple_hw_check - For solving dependencies...if this file runs on your server, the bertopic file should also.
- bertopic jupyterlab - Importing output from csv_parse and training the model in a jupyterlab enviroment
- GPU accell. Bertopic for collab - Version of bertopic with gpu accellerated components for use in google collab

#To be used later
- bertopic playground - Playground to understand and compare saved model.

Currently, this project is in progress.
