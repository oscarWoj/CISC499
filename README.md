# CISC499
Independent research project on the content of a dark web cyber blackhat forum. 
Utilized BERTopic neural network to parse and analyze conversations, resulting in a deeper understanding of the topics discussed by participants. 
Further work will be done to isolate specific conversations for further analysis to aid in protecting against cyber attacks.

Contents:
- csv_parse.ipynb - Processing raw data into the proper input for BERTopic. Applying reduction techniques to further reduce the complexity of the data
- bertopic.ipynb - Importing output from csv_parse and training a BERTopic model.
- bertopic playground - Testing and comparing saved models

Both of these files take a significant amount of time to run, for the readers sake, we will keep the outputs of the files completed and visible on Github whenever we can.
